              Hello! It's so nice that you're taking a moment out of your busy life to check out this
              little project. Go through this mock-up and play around ‚Äî it‚Äôs meant to be fun and super simple.
              <br /><br />
              But first let's get started with a little introduction.

              CoFilt is your personal feed for company updates. It‚Äôs a focused space where you only 
              see what truly matters to you ‚Äî no endless scrolling, no irrelevant posts, and especially no noise.
              <br /><br />
              Whether it's job offers, financial updates, events, or news, CoFilt filters it all
              based on your interests and delivers a clean, focused stream of updates.
            </>

              In the real version of CoFilt, you‚Äôll be able to create an account using your personal email
              and securely log in to access your customized feed.
              <br /><br />
              This mock-up shows you what that could feel like ‚Äî everything here is pre-filled just
              to give you a taste of the real experience.
              <br /><br />
              I would say it's time to hit the Login button to see the next page.

            This is where your personalized feed begins. You choose which companies you want to follow from a handpicked list ‚Äî companies like Google, Tesla, Netflix, and more.
            <br /><br />
            For each company, you can select the type of content you're interested in: Jobs, News, Events, Social, or Financial. It's all in your hands.

            This page is the heart of CoFilt. Every selection you make here shapes your feed. Nothing irrelevant, nothing you didn‚Äôt ask for ‚Äî just the updates you care about.
            <br /><br />
            Your time is valuable, and your feed should respect that. CoFilt makes sure you only see what actually matters to you.

            In the real CoFilt experience, you‚Äôll be free to follow all the companies available on the platform ‚Äî and decide for each one exactly which areas you're interested in.
            <br /><br />
            Once you‚Äôve made your selections, they‚Äôll be saved to your account and can be adjusted at any time. Think of it like subscribing to a newspaper ‚Äî but instead of getting the whole paper, you only see the sections that truly matter to you.
            <br /><br />
            Try it out. Add some companies and topics to your selection and hit the button.
